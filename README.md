Practicing git repo
Describe yourself they say. Well, I like to start of with I am different. But I am also same. 
And now, I have bored my self. Better shut up. At this point, one would delete all they wrote (even though it's a few lines)
But, I think we need to accept ourselves. However we are. Not to say we dont change those faults but we accept them as part of us
in a way that we forgive ourselves.
If all this makes no sense to you, just know I had a long day and I cant even study anymore. :)




      In God we believe....
